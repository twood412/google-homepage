The Odin Project: Google Homepage

The assignment was to recreate the Google homepage appearance. Functionality was less important, but I tried to include as much as I could at my current skill level. 

The nav links will take you to the exact page as the original Google homepage links would. The search bar doesn't do anything, and the buttons won't take you anywhere. 

I tried to include as many of the less obvious CSS styles as I could, such as box-shadows and borders while hovering over an element.

The one element that truly eluded me was the search icon inside the search bar. I could get the icon on the page, but couldn't figure out how to move it where I needed it to go, so that's on my list of things to learn.

Overall, I had a lot of fun building the Google homepage and I'm excited to move on to the next project.
